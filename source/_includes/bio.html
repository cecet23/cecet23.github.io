After completing my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at <a href="http://www.dmi.unipg.it/"> University of Perugia</a>, I jumped into the IT industry without the slightest hesitation.
	  <br><br> Two years at <a href="https://www.ptvgroup.com"> Ptvgroup </a> as a software engineer helped me kick off my career and taught me how to work as a team player to deliver windows mobile application.
	  Now I'm working as a System Engineer for <a href="http://www.fsbusitalia.it/" >FS Busitalia </a> and I'm fully committed to implement and maintain the organization's technology infrastructure.
	  <br><br>I'm well organized and I always look for challenges and opportunities in the technology space, and strive to work on exciting products/services..
		<br>I easly dive in every project trying to learn as much as I can along the way.	
	<br><br> When I'm not honing my computers skills, you can find me involved in some sports, dancing some <a href="http://tarantarci.blogspot.it/">popular music </a>or pouring down a few craft brews. 
	<br><br> Below you can find my personal notes that I want to share with everyone
